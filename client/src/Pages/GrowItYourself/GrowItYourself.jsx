                <h3>Essential Needes to Grow Organic Vegetables:</h3>
                <p>
                    <strong>Sunshine:</strong> Most vegetables require full sun during the day. It's important to plant them in your backyard where the sun is not blocked by other objects.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Good Soil:</strong> All veggies need the best organic soil mix to grow to their full potential. The qualities to look for in good soil are fertility and texture. 
                    Adding one or more forms of organic matter promotes the healthiest soil for vegetable growth and development.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Seeds or Seedlings:</strong> Decide whether you want to start from seeds or purchase young seedlings. For beginners, seedlings is the better option.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Watering:</strong> Maintain a consistent watering schedule. Water in the morning to allow the soil to dry during the day.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Space:</strong> There are many different ways to plant your veggies â€“ garden beds, plots in the ground, planters, pots, vertical gardens, and more.
